// ******************************************   130. Surrounded Regions   ***************************************** //
// Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
// A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

console.log(
  solve([
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],

// Example 1:
// https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg
// Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
// Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
// Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
// - It is on the border, or
// - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
// The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
// The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

// Example 2:
// Input: board = [["X"]]
// Output: [["X"]]

// Constraints:
// m == board.length
// n == board[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 200
// board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
